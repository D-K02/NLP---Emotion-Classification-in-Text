# Emotion Classification in Text Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at classifying emotions expressed in text samples. The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the data, extract features, and train models that can accurately identify emotions such as joy, anger, and fear.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is `nlp_dataset.csv`, which includes various text samples along with their corresponding emotional labels. Each entry consists of a comment and the emotion it conveys.

### Sample Data
| Comment                                                                                                   | Emotion |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| I seriously hate one subject to death but now I feel reluctant to drop it.                               | fear    |
| I feel so full of life I feel appalled.                                                                   | anger   |
| I finally fell asleep feeling angry, useless and still full of anxiety.                                   | anger   |
| I feel like I have regained another vital part of my life which is living.                               | joy     |

## Project Structure
- `nlp_dataset.csv`: The dataset containing text samples and their associated emotions.
- `emotion_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for loading, preprocessing the data, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the required Python packages for running the project.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can set up the environment by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-classification.git
   cd emotion-classification
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the `emotion_classification.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
2. Run the cells sequentially to load the dataset, preprocess the text data, extract features, train the models (Naive Bayes and SVM), and evaluate their performance.
3. Review the model comparison results to see which model performs better in classifying emotions.

## Results
The models are evaluated based on accuracy and F1 score:
- **Naive Bayes**: Accuracy: 0.91, F1 Score: 0.91
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Accuracy: 0.95, F1 Score: 0.95

The SVM model demonstrates superior performance in classifying emotions compared to Naive Bayes.
